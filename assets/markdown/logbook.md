### Work done

- Add music file sharing and start playlist development
- Combine properties in musicsFile and playlist classes
- Improve music display and fix server disconnect bugs
- Optimize help command and update utils with dark purple

- Update .gitignore and prepare for client listening
- Introduce HandeShareUnshare on the server for code reuse
- Implement playlist sharing, correct Test command issues

### problems

I had difficulties at first to optimize the code of sharing and unsharing a musics or a playlist because there was a lot of code duplication. I have solved this problem by creating a new class with a bolean to determine if the command is a share or a unshare and a method to handle the command.

## 17 december 2023 Part 1

### Work done

- Add classes to allow to save information about the client and the server on a json file
- Add the gson dependency to the project
- Use System.out.println insted of Utils.p because it add just more complexity
- Add the disconnect command

### problems

- Find a proper way to save the information about the Entry list i have on the client because i was using a Abstract class and GSON can't serialize abstract class. I have solved this problem by adding a type field to each subclass of Entry and by creating a custom serializer for the Entry class.

## 17 december 2023 Part 2

### Work done

- Add a new class to handle thread data on the server

## problems

- I had a problem with the thread data class because i was not using a list of thread data but a single variable to store the client socket or it listening port and when i connect a second client the first one was disconnected. I have solved this problem by creating a list of a new class that store the client socket and it listening port and it ip address.

## 20 december 2023

### Work done

- Create a class Colors and move every colors in this class
- Update init command to add listening port

## Special information

Because of big functionnalities and the fact that i have to do a lot of refactoring i have decided to not had a lookbook of each day beceause it will be only thing like "do some refactoring" or "add a new class" and it will be not very interesting to read. I rather prefer to do a lookbook of each big functionnalities when they are finished and with that i can explain how i have done it and what problem i have encountered.

## 21-24 december 2023


### Work done

- Create a Storage class to merge similar code beetween the 2 StorageClient and StorageServer class
- Create a ServerManagerClass to handle the managmenent  more easily on the client and the init for the server
- Create the command play

Start the implementation for playing a music on the client

- Create the Command HandleGetInfo to be use wth the command play on the client
- Prepare the class StreamEntry on the Server
- Rename a lot of variables to have a better concistency (ServerThreadData -> ThreadData, CommandClient to Commmand,ClientAdress -> local adrress, ...) and add commentary

### problems

I begin to have to much code on the project and when i want to do something i pass the a lot of time doing something else because there is a bug here or i have to refactor this class. I have solved this problem by creating  a lot of TODO in the code and i will do them when i finish the implementation of my current functionnality.

## 24-25 december 2023

I just have read the code and do some minor correction and it was also christmasüéÅ

## 26-27 december 2023

### Work done

- Add the JavaZoom library to the project
- Update the init to be at the start of the program to be able to update the listening port
- Add 2 new classes to handle new logSystem for the server
- Add logs to the server classes
- Correct the share file command to be fully functionnal

### problems

- had some problems with the client server beceause the second client was not able to create his listening server. I have solved this problem by adding a verification at the start of the client in the init command to check if the port is already used and if it is used i will ask the user to enter a new port even if he choos the config file option.
